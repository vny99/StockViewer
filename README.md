You can start the app by following these steps
1. fort this branch to your local
2. npm install --legacy-peer-deps
3. npm run dev

Don't forget to replace the Stocks APP_URL and API_KEY in the .env file to access and get the real time  stock data ( I used tiingo).
Mongo DB should be installed and configured in order to run the application. you have to provide its url in .env.
